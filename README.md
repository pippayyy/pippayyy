### Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height="30"/> I'm Pip! 

If you had told me 5 years ago that I would find programming **really cool** I would have laughed. Actually probably not because I didn't know what coding was. Python was nothing more than a snake.

My passion for creativity and problem solving have helped me learn to code and made me never want to stop.
